    "# 15.8. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a revolutionary pre-trained language model that has significantly advanced natural language processing tasks. Unlike traditional models that process text sequentially, BERT reads text bidirectionally, allowing it to understand context from both directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features of BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bidirectional Context**: BERT considers both left and right context simultaneously\n",
    "- **Pre-training and Fine-tuning**: Uses unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning\n",
    "- **Transformer Architecture**: Built on the transformer encoder architecture\n",
    "- **Masked Language Modeling**: Pre-trained using masked token prediction\n",
    "- **Next Sentence Prediction**: Learns relationships between sentence pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT excels in various NLP tasks including:\n",
    "- Text classification\n",
    "- Named entity recognition\n",
    "- Question answering\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis\n",
    "- Language inference\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BERT-Base**: 12 layers, 768 hidden units, 12 attention heads\n",
    "- **BERT-Large**: 24 layers, 1024 hidden units, 16 attention heads"
